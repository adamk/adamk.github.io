      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>Static ("naive") gamma & delta maps built from yesterday's open interest (OI) are great for pre‑market terrain mapping (where are the big strikes, possible pin areas, regime bias) but are not sufficient for intraday 0DTE trade timing because they ignore same‑day opening/closing flow.</p>
        <p>Intraday CBOE Open–Close 10‑minute interval data lets you see actual customer positioning (Buy‑to‑Open vs Sell‑to‑Open activity) in Calls and Puts. Converting those flows to delta (via CBOE Trades/Quotes Greeks) shows how much directional risk dealers inherit in real time.</p>
        <p>Directional Entry Rule: Focus on dominant Long Call (customer buy-to-open calls) or dominant Long Put (customer buy-to-open Puts) flow at or near the strike you're trading. These represent new directional risk customers are taking today; dealers take the other side and must hedge, creating tradeable flows.</p>
        <p>Do not use Short Calls / Short Puts (customer sell-to-open) as primary entry signals. Those flows often reflect income trades, overwrites, spreads, or hedge monetization; they more often modulate or accelerate existing moves rather than initiate direction.</p>
        <p>Charting price action (ICT / SMC concepts) is a proxy — a visual abstraction of order flow. Options flow, when correctly parsed, is objective transaction data. Use the chart to see where price reacts; use the flow to know why and how much dealer hedging fuel remains.</p>
        <p>Late‑day charm & hedge decay windows plus documented end‑of‑day dealer rebalancing can produce outsized reversals or accelerations, suitable for "lotto" plays.</p>

        <h3>0. Map vs Territory: Charting, Flow, and the "Naive" View of Information</h3>
        <p>The book, <em>Nexus</em>, by Yuval Harari describes a naive view of information that treats data points as an attempt to represent reality; when the representation is wrong, we label it misinformation (honest error) or disinformation (intentional distortion). In markets, a price chart is always a representation, never the full territory. It compresses the totality of order flow, inventory transfer, hedging, and structural constraints into a single time‑price trace.</p>
        <blockquote>"The naive view sees information as an attempt to represent reality… Misinformation is an honest mistake; disinformation is a deliberate lie. The naive view further believes that the solution to the problems caused by misinformation and disinformation is more information."</blockquote>
        <p>ICT/SMC style chart reading excels at spotting where liquidity may rest (highs/lows, FVGs, imbalance zones), useful abstractions no doubt! But without flow context you can't distinguish who is trapped, who must hedge, or how mechanical any move might become. Perhaps that's why some fair value gaps (FVGs) may be respected, while others may not. A tool called GEXStream provides a "flow ratio" that gets close, but still it does not give you a per-strike break-down of open contracts. Intraday options flow is objective: contracts traded, side, open/close, strike, expiry. When you delta‑weight that flow you move from map to a higher‑resolution terrain model that shows the sources of fuel behind price moves.</p>
        <p>Essentially, when a market maker sells you an option, they inherit directional exposure (delta). To control risk, they buy or sell pieces of the underlying index (or futures) so their net delta is near zero ("delta neutral"). As price, volatility, and time change, they rebalance. Those hedge adjustments are flows that can push the market.</p>
        <p><strong>Working synthesis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use ICT‑style levels to stage trades at areas where liquidity is likely concentrated.</li>
          <li>Use Long Call / Long Put dominance data to decide whether to engage at those levels and in which direction.</li>
          <li>Use short‑side (STO) flows only as context — they can accelerate or dampen the move from your entry zone but rarely define the initial directional edge.</li>
        </ul>
