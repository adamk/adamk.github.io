        <h3>2. Quick Greek Refresher for Intraday 0DTE Decisions</h3>
        <p>Delta = price sensitivity to underlying moves.</p>
        <p>Gamma = rate of change of delta with price.</p>
        <p>Charm (aka delta decay) = change in delta with the passage of time; explodes in importance into expiration.</p>
        <p>When dealers are long gamma, their hedges sell strength / buy weakness → volatility dampening → pinning near large strikes. When short gamma, hedges chase → volatility amplification. 0DTE accelerates these dynamics because time (theta) is collapsing every minute.</p>

        <h3>3. The "Naive" Gamma / Delta Approach (Static OI Models)</h3>
        <h4>3.1 What It Is</h4>
        <p>Community gamma dashboards (e.g., SpotGamma‑style, Gexbot-style, etc.) start with the previous night's open interest for each strike/expiry. They then price Greeks off current underlying & IV surface and assume dealer inventory sign (commonly: dealers short puts / long calls) to aggregate Gamma Exposure (GEX) and Estimated Dealer Delta by strike.</p>

        <h4>3.2 Why Traders Use It</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Fast morning scan of terrain: where are the big OI clusters that might pin price?</li>
          <li>Regime gauge: estimated market‑wide long vs short gamma.</li>
          <li>Reference levels: potential "gamma flip" or "zero‑gamma" inflection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3.3 Structural Weaknesses for 0DTE</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stale: OI frozen from prior close ignores today's opening flow (which dominates 0DTE).</li>
          <li>Dealer sign ambiguous: heuristics can invert intraday.</li>
          <li>Can't separate open vs close: you don't know if volume added new risk or flattened old.</li>
          <li>Spread blindness: multi‑leg structures smear gamma across strikes unseen in raw OI.</li>
          <li>Timing blind: no insight into when hedges rebalance (critical late‑day).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Use static gamma maps as context only. They frame expectations but are not trade triggers in a high‑velocity 0DTE world.</p>

        <h3>4. Intraday CBOE Open–Close 10‑Minute Interval Data</h3>
        <h4>4.1 What You Get</h4>
        <p>Unlike individual equity options, where trades and quotes must be aggregated across multiple exchanges (CBOE, NYSE Arca, Nasdaq BX, etc.) to reconstruct a complete tape, SPX and SPXW options trades execute solely on CBOE. This gives CBOE a practical monopoly on the real-time SPX options data (e.g., Open-Close intervals). No need to stitch together disparate feeds.</p>

        <h4>4.2 Why It Matters for 0DTE</h4>
        <p>For every option series that trades within each 10‑minute window, the Open–Close file reports:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Call vs Put</li>
          <li>Buy or Sell</li>
          <li>Opening or Closing</li>
          <li>Customer origin type (customer, professional customer, broker‑dealer, market maker)</li>
          <li>Contract volume</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is actual executed flow, tagged for new risk vs unwind. Today's opening flow is what dealers must hedge today. Seeing buy-to-open (BTO) vs sell-to-open (STO) intraday lets you infer the live dealer inventory changes that static OI misses.</p>

        <h4>4.3 The Four Core Buckets (Customer View → Dealer Implication)</h4>
        <p>The key: Enter directional 0DTE positions only when Long Call or Long Put customer opening flow is dominant and aligns with your price level. Treat dominant Short Call or Short Put customer opening flow as context.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Heavy Long Call or Long Put Flow</strong> = Reversal Candidate.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy Short Call or Short Put Flow</strong> = Momentum Accelerator / Cap.</li>
          <li><strong>Gamma</strong> = Target Map; <strong>Delta</strong> = Trigger.</li>
          <li><strong>Charm</strong> as end-of-day (EOD) Magnet.</li>
        </ul>
