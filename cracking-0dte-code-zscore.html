      <!-- Glossary -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">📘 Quick Glossary</h2>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li><strong>IV (Implied Volatility):</strong> The market’s forecast of future volatility, reflected in option pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Extrinsic Value:</strong> The portion of an option’s price beyond intrinsic value; mainly driven by IV and time decay.</li>
          <li><strong>Extrinsic Slope:</strong> The rate of change in extrinsic value. Positive = IV expansion; negative = IV compression (shown as green/red in the ToS lower study).</li>
          <li><strong>z-Score (EX z-Score):</strong> Measures how high or low the current extrinsic value is relative to its intraday mean.</li>
          <li><strong>RVOL (Relative Volume):</strong> Compares current volume to its average for that time of day; confirms when dealer hedging flow is active.</li>
          <li><strong>Regime (R1 / R4 / R5):</strong> Context for dealer positioning:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>R1</strong> = SPY opens inside yesterday’s range (neutral gamma)</li>
              <li><strong>R4</strong> = Premarket high is above yesterday’s high (dealers short calls)</li>
              <li><strong>R5</strong> = Premarket low is below yesterday’s low (dealers short puts)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Charm:</strong> The rate of delta decay with time, which drives end-of-day hedging bursts.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Problem -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">Problem</h2>
        <p>Our original divergence indicator, specifically the extrinsic element, worked best when implied volatility was compressing, the ideal “dealer-hedging environment.”</p>
        <p>But on days when volatility expanded instead of flattening, the tool lost its edge:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bearish EX divergences would appear prematurely and fail.</li>
          <li>SPY could keep grinding without a bullish signal as implied volatility reprices higher.</li>
          <li>No clear signal existed to show why the divergence wasn’t actionable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-0">That limitation wasn’t the indicator’s fault; it was the market’s volatility regime shifting.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Solution -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">Solution (z-Score Framework)</h2>
        <p>The new <strong>Extrinsic Slope + z-Score Monitor</strong> study fixes that blind spot. It adds context to every divergence by revealing what the option’s implied volatility is doing intraday.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Extrinsic Slope:</strong> “Is IV compressing or expanding?”
            <ul>
              <li>Measures the rate of change of extrinsic value.</li>
              <li>Negative slope = IV compression → dealer hedging pressure / controlled sell.</li>
              <li>Positive slope = IV expansion → vol repricing or unwind flow.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>This tells you why an option’s premium is behaving differently from SPY.</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>z-Score of Extrinsic:</strong> “Is premium high, normal, or cheap?”
            <ul>
              <li>High z (+4 to +6) = over-inflated premium → potential vol-crush fade.</li>
              <li>Low z (−4 to −6) = deflated premium → possible unwind / bounce setup.</li>
              <li>Crossings of z = 0 often mark the transition between compression and expansion phases.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Interpretations -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">How to Interpret Dealer/MM Reactions with Context</h2>
        <p>For the first time, we can see the volatility regime forming in real time, not infer it afterward.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Regime Context -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">The Regime Context Returns</h2>
        <p>The extrinsic z-score completes the regime map first laid out in Part 2. It quantifies how implied volatility evolves within each regime, whether dealers are expanding, compressing, or stabilizing IV as they hedge.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>R1:</strong> Neutral Gamma → balanced dealers, direction comes from IV behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>R4:</strong> Above Range (Short Calls) → bearish gap-fade or vol-crush continuation.</li>
          <li><strong>R5:</strong> Below Range (Short Puts) → panic sell → bullish unwind reversal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>R2, R3, and R6 are low-frequency environments that rarely produce actionable intraday signals, so the framework focuses on the dominant regimes: R1, R4, and R5.</p>
        <p>The z-score complements the slope, showing how elevated or depressed extrinsic value is relative to its intraday mean. Together, they reveal not just what IV is doing (expanding vs compressing) but how extreme or stable that activity has become.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rising z while SPY falls → volatility expansion / dealer hedging pressure.</li>
          <li>Falling z while SPY rises → volatility compression or unwind.</li>
          <li>Flat z + negative slope → controlled compression or low-energy drift.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-0"><em>The following regime-specific patterns show how slope + z-score interact to reveal dealer positioning in real time.</em></p>
      </section>

      <!-- R1 -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">🟩 Regime 1: Inside Prior Range (Neutral Gamma)</h3>
        <p><strong>Dealer posture:</strong> Balanced. Direction depends on IV behavior and z-score slope.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Upside Breakout:</strong> z-score starts deeply negative (−4 → −2 → 0) and rises with SPY.<br>
            → IV expands with price → dealers hedge with the move → <strong>bullish continuation</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Downside Breakout:</strong> z-score near 0 → falls negative while SPY drops.<br>
            → IV expands against price → dealers hedge against the move → <strong>bearish continuation</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Compression Sell-Off:</strong> z-score extremely negative (−6 → −1) but SPY keeps drifting down on flat IV.<br>
            → <strong>Bearish continuation.</strong> Wait for z-score to cross 0 + RVOL uptick before longing → bullish reversal zone once vol stabilizes.</li>
          <li><strong>Controlled Compression Sell (R1-CC):</strong> z-score flat or slightly rising (−4 → −3), extrinsic slope negative (compression), SPY drifting or falling steadily.<br>
            → Dealers are selling vol into the decline, allowing price to slide in an orderly bleedout → <strong>bearish bias</strong> until extrinsic slope flattens or turns positive (vol stops compressing).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- R4 -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">🟥 Regime 4: Opens Above Prior Range (Dealers Short Calls)</h3>
        <p><strong>Dealer posture:</strong> Short call gamma = they short SPY as vol expands.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>R4-S (Standard Gap-Fade Start):</strong> z-score high (+3 → +5) then falls with SPY → IV expanding = <strong>bearish fade</strong> of the gap.</li>
          <li><strong>R4-C (Compressed Start):</strong> z-score starts negative (−3 → −4) and rises toward 0 while SPY drifts down.<br>
            → Rising z-score against falling SPY = IV repricing higher, not new hedging → <strong>bearish bias</strong> until z-score flattens near 0.</li>
          <li><strong>R4-R (Reversal / Unwind Phase):</strong> z-score starts elevated (+1 → +2), then compresses through to around −2 as SPY fades. Once z-score turns back up and crosses above 0, dealers begin to unwind short hedges, triggering a <strong>bullish reversal</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>R4-VC (Vol-Crush Continuation):</strong> z-score very high (+4 → +6) then falls while SPY grinds up → IV collapsing = <strong>bullish trend holds</strong> as dealers stop hedging.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- R5 -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">🟦 Regime 5: Opens Below Prior Range (Dealers Short Puts)</h3>
        <p><strong>Dealer posture:</strong> Short put gamma = they must buy SPY on declines.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>R5-E (Expansion Start / Capitulation):</strong> z-score very negative (−4 → −6) = vol expansion and panic hedging → <strong>bearish leg down</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>R5-C (Compressed Start / Controlled Buy):</strong> z-score flat (−3 → −2) and extrinsic slope slightly positive; SPY grinds up slowly → <strong>bullish continuation</strong> from open until z-score stalls or turns down.</li>
          <li><strong>R5-R (Reversal / Unwind Phase):</strong> z-score curves up (−6 → −2 → −1) as SPY fades lower, IV begins re-expanding as dealers start buying → <strong>bullish unwind</strong> as hedges flip near z-score ≈ −1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small text-muted">
          Note: Regime 5 only includes three practical setups. Put-side gamma reactions are asymmetric, so once dealers hedge the initial selloff, the sequence typically transitions directly from panic expansion (R5-E) to compression and unwind (R5-C → R5-R), without the extended vol-crush continuation seen in R4.
        </p>

      <!-- Rhythm -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">Time-of-Day Edge (The Gamma–Theta Rhythm)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>09:30–10:00:</strong> IV repricing chaos → mostly avoid trades.</li>
          <li><strong>10:00–12:30:</strong> Prime window → gamma stable, IV measurable.</li>
          <li><strong>12:30–13:30:</strong> Low RVOL → skip choppy compression.</li>
          <li><strong>15:30+:</strong> Charm magnets → quick ATM scalps only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-0">Most of your best setups will appear in that 10 to 11 AM window when IV stabilizes and hedging flows normalize.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Why proxies don't work -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">Why SPY Implied Volatility and VXX Don’t Work</h2>
        <p>Those proxies track index-level implied vol, not the live premium structure of the option you’re trading. You must read extrinsic value from the option itself. That said, using VXX key levels (PML, PMH, YDL, YDH) can still be useful for take-profit timing as they often align with short-term vol spikes or compressions that mark the end of a move.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Final Thoughts -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This update bridges all five parts of the series:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> MM Gamma → “0DTE flow is a product of dealer positioning, gamma exposure, and intraday volatility shifts.”</li>
          <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> The Regime Model → “Know the environment.”</li>
          <li><strong>Part 3–4:</strong> The Divergence Tool → “See the turning points.”</li>
          <li><strong>Part 5:</strong> The z-Score Playbook → “Understand why/when the turn is happening with higher accuracy.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, each divergence you see isn’t just a pattern on a chart, it’s a window into dealer positioning, volatility repricing, and flow intensity.</p>

        <h3 class="h6">🧠 Summary Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>z falling with SPY → IV expanding against price → hedging pressure → <strong>bearish</strong>.</li>
          <li>z rising with SPY → IV expanding with price → dealer unwind → <strong>bullish</strong>.</li>
          <li>z rising while SPY falls → vol repricing → controlled sell bias (<strong>R4-C / R5-E</strong>).</li>
          <li>z very high then falling while SPY rises → vol crush continuation (<strong>R4-VC</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-3">Together, slope and z-score act as the volatility compass. The slope tells you what’s happening to IV, and z-score shows how extreme or balanced that behavior has become.</p>
